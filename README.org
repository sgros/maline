* Introduction

#+HTML: <img src="docs/images/maline-logo.png" alt="maline logo" title="maline" align="right" />

*maline* is a free software Android malware detection framework. If you are an
Org-mode user, you might want to read the [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][executable version]] of this readme
(the README.org file in the root). If you are interested in running extensive
experiments with *maline*, take a look at the README file in the =env/emulab=
directory, where you can find a lot of information on setting up a
reproducible research environment.

* Installation
*NOTE: We are in the process of debugging instructions for running maline in a
virtual machine as there are some issues with that. Us, authors, got it
successfully working on physical machines only.*

*maline* has been developed under Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS. It is very likely it
will work under other POSIX systems too (GNU/Linux and Mac alike). The Android
version we tested *maline* with is Android 4.4.3 (API version 19), which is
assumed throughout the readme.

To make it easier to start using *maline*, we created a Vagrant configuration
file that sets up a virtual machine and install *maline* in it. If you want to
run *maline* in such a way, you can simply run the following command in the
root of this project:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
  vagrant up
#+END_SRC

and skip the rest of this section on dependencies and installing
them. However, you will need to install an Android Virtual Device, as
described [[https://github.com/soarlab/maline#sec-3-3][below]].

** Dependencies
To use *maline*, you need the following:

- Android SDK - please [[http://www.cs.utah.edu/formal_verification/downloads/custom-android-sdk.tar.xz][download and use our build]] of the SDK. It is a
  stripped-down version with multiple bug fixes applied. Based on our
  experience, it is very unlikely *maline* will work correctly with the
  official version provided by Google. The official version ships without the
  fixes for multiple showstopping bugs.
- [[http://openjdk.java.net/][OpenJDK 7]]
- [[https://code.google.com/p/android-apktool/][apktool]] - *maline* already ships with apktool, which is licensed under the
  Apache License 2.0.
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/][GNU Octave]] - a programming language for numerical computations. It is
  available through a Ubuntu's default repository.
- [[http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/][LIBSVM]] - *maline* already ships with LIBSVM, which is licensed under the
  Modified BSD License.
- [[http://www.r-project.org/][R]] - an environment for statistical computing and graphics.
- [[http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/][Bash]] - ships with Ubuntu.
- [[https://www.python.org/][Python]] - pretty much every system has an installation of it. We tested the
  tool with version 2.7.3.
- [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/expect/][expect]] - a command line tool that automates interactive applications. It is
  available through a Ubuntu's default repository.

There are other dependencies we used throughout the project - such as for
building Android from source - that you might not need to simply use
*maline*. An extensive list of such dependencies and particular packages of
the tools listed above can be found in =env/emulab/prepare-node.sh=.

** Building
First obtain *maline*, e.g. from Github:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
  mkdir ~/projects
  cd ~/projects
  git clone git@github.com:soarlab/maline.git
#+END_SRC

Then change directory and build *maline* by running =make=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
  cd maline
  make
#+END_SRC

* Configuration

** Unpacking the SDK
Let's assume you have downloaded [[http://www.cs.utah.edu/formal_verification/downloads/custom-android-sdk.tar.xz][the custom SDK]] into your home directory. This
is how you would unpack it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
  tar -C ~/projects/ -xf ~/custom-android-sdk.tar.xz
#+END_SRC

** Path to Executables
*maline* needs an environment variable named =$MALINE=, which should point to
the tool root directory. In addition, it's =bin/= directory should be in the
PATH variable. A few tools provided with the SDK should be on the path as
well. Therefore, execute the following commands:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
  export MALINE=~/projects/maline
  PATH=$MALINE/bin:~/projects/custom-android-sdk/tools:~/projects/custom-android-sdk/platform-tools:$PATH
#+END_SRC

** Android Virtual Device
*maline* executes Android apps in the Android Emulator, which comes within the
Android SDK. The Emulator is a QEMU-based emulator that runs Android Virtual
Devices (AVDs). By default, the ARM architecture is emulated, but that is very
slow. Instead, on an =x86= host machine it is better to create an =x86=
architecture-based virtual device image.

To create an x86-based AVD device, run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
  avd-create.sh -a x86 -d maline-avd
#+END_SRC

The device creation process usually takes about 5 minutes.

Now you have a clean environment where each app can be executed. That is so
because the above executed =avd-create.sh= command creates an AVD device with
a clean snapshot that will be reloaded every time a new app is analyzed.

You can check that the device is created by executing:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
  android list avd
#+END_SRC

You should see a device with a name =maline-avd=.

* Usage
In order to execute Android apps in *maline*, one first needs to create a list
of the apps. For example, let's assume that there are 6 apps in the =apps/=
sub-directory within the root *maline* directory. Then their list can be
stored to a file =apk-list-file= that has paths to the apps:

#+BEGIN_SRC text
  ~/projects/maline/apps/com.nephoapp.anarxiv_1.apk
  ~/projects/maline/apps/org.ale.scanner.zotero_2.apk
  ~/projects/maline/apps/ed8a51225a3862e30817640ba7ec5b88ee04c98a.apk
  ~/projects/maline/apps/vu.de.urpool.quickdroid_49.apk
  ~/projects/maline/apps/to.networld.android.divedroid_1.apk
  ~/projects/maline/apps/4147f7d801c4bc5241536886309d507c5124fe3b.apk
#+END_SRC

It is assumed that malicious applications have file names consisting of 64
hexadecimal characters. That is how *maline* distinguishes malicious from
benign apps in its learning phase.

To execute the apps and get their execution logs, run the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
  maline.sh -f apk-list-file -d maline-avd
#+END_SRC

As *maline* is executing, obtained =.log= files are parsed and as a result one
=.graph= file per =.log= file is generated. From the =.graph= files we
generate a feature vector for every analyzed app by executing:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
  create-feature-matrix.sh regular
#+END_SRC

Now it is possible to classify the data by running the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
  run-classdroid.sh FEATURES_FILE SHUFFLE_MODE [0 | 1]
#+END_SRC

The classification used is Support Vector Machine (SVM).
A new folder will be created to store the temporary file used for the
classification process and a file called "result.dat" will contain the
final results.

The SVM methods used consists in classify the features using Linear and Polynomial
Kernel (from 1st to 4th degree) applying 50% or 90% of the data set for training.

* Emulab
In the development of *maline*, we have been using [[http://www.emulab.net][Emulab]] extensively. Emulab
is a network testbed developed by [[http://www.flux.utah.edu/][The Flux Research Group]] from the University
of Utah. We are thankful to the group for providing us with such an amazing
computing infrastructure!
